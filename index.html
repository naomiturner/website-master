    <h1>I'm Naomi.</h1>
    <p>I'm looking for my next role in Product, Design Research or Strategy.</p>
    <p>Most recently, I was a Product Manager at HMPPS, Ministry of Justice, exploring digital services for prisoners. Previously I was User Lead for the Connected Communities team at Co-op Digital.</p>
    <p>I started out as a Caseworker for a Member of Parliament, as Head of Design and Manufacturing Policy at a political <a href="https://www.policyconnect.org.uk/apdig/">thinktank</a>, and as a Private Secretary at the Ministry of Justice.</p>
    <p>I built a tool to support <a href="https://nearnow.org.uk/stories/re-imagining-childcare-introducing-kidoop">childcare co-operatives</a>, and worked with MPs to use <a href="http://www.designforeurope.eu/news-opinion/design-politics-using-design-fiction-prototype-new-policies">speculative design</a> to explore the future of assisted dying.</p>
    <p>In my spare time, I co-organise a festival celebrating <a href="https://festivalofmaintenance.org.uk/">maintenance</a> and what it can teach us about being better custodians of technology and communities.</p>
    <p>I'm enthusiastic about data minimisation and making policy tangible through design.</p>
