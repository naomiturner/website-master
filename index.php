    <h1>I'm Naomi.</h1>
    <p>Currently Product Manager at HMPPS, Ministry of Justice, researching and building user-centred services for prisoners. Prior to that I worked as a Caseworker for a Member of Parliament, as Head of Design and Manufacturing Policy at a thinktank, and as a Private Secretary at the Ministry of Justice.</p>
    <p>I have helped to build a tool to support childcare cooperatives, initiated a library of patterns for GDPR, and worked with MPs to use speculative design to explore the future of assisted dying.</p>
    <p>In my spare time, I co-organise a festival celebrating maintenance and what it can teach us about being better custodians of technology and communities.</p>
    <p>I'm enthusiastic about making policy tangible through design, data minimisation and dancing.</p>
